# Tasks
* Can't use two providers (try it) maybe bcuz of sqlite. UPDATE: Think I solved it, test it. UPDATE: Specifically, I think I meant I solved it because you can set different db file paths for each provider
* `mysql` and `postgresql`
* Autogenerating the shared secret?
* Also, am I even connecting the runners with the server?
* Also I need to connect the docker runner to the docker daemon
